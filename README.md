Missing and Spurious Interactions in Complex Networks

Description:
Implementation of a framework to evaluate the reliability of network data and reconstruct complex networks, following the method proposed by Guimer√† & Sales-Pardo (2009). The project involves:

Loading and processing weighted adjacency matrices to define true network structures.

Introducing and analyzing missing and spurious interactions.

Reconstructing network topology and assessing prediction accuracy.

Visualizing results using Python libraries (networkx, matplotlib, seaborn).

Technologies & Concepts:
Python, Network Science, Graph Theory, Data Analysis, Computational Modeling, Visualization.
